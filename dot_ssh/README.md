# dotfiles

These dotfiles are managed with [`chezmoi`](chezmoi.io) and the secrets with 1Password. Thus setting it up, requires the [1password cli](https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/)

These dotfiles can be applied with `sh -c "$(curl -fsLS git.io/chezmoi)" -- init --apply justusschock`
